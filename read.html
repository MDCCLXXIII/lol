    <p>People call us criminals, but most of the time we're just proving what everyone quietly suspect, that the systems
      they trust aren't as secure as they think. We find the cracks because we're looking for them, while everyone else
      assumes they're not there. <r>It's not always about stealing or causing damage.</r> Sometimes it's about
      understanding how things really work, especially when the people in charge don't. And if we push boundaries, it's
      because boundaries are often designed to protect the wrong things.</p>
